Hi there! I am a software engineer who is passionate about creating innovative solutions that solve complex problems. With 5 years of experience in the industry, I have honed my skills in software development, testing, and project management. I thrive in fast-paced environments and am always looking for new challenges that push me to learn and grow.

My expertise lies in full-stack web development, where I have experience with a variety of languages and frameworks, including Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, and SQL. I am comfortable working in both front-end and back-end development, I am also enthusiastic about using artificial intelligence and machine learning to develop innovative solutuions, and am well-versed in database design and management.

What sets me apart is my ability to collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams and communicate technical information to non-technical stakeholders. I am committed to delivering high-quality products that exceed customer expectations while maintaining a strong focus on scalability and maintainability.

When I am not coding, I enjoy reading about the latest industry trends and attending tech conferences to expand my knowledge and network. I am also an avid traveler, I like playing football, and enjoy experiencing different cultures and cuisines.

Feel free to check out my Github profile to see some of my previous projects and contributions to the open-source community.
